The need for motivation is directly proportional to the size of the change we want to have in our lives. So, we can split the big changes we want in our lives and make them as tiny as possible so that we don't need a lot of motivation to make that change.

### Question 2__How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

M - motivation
A - Ability
p - Prompt

I will drop a linked in post every time after I learn a new thing (even it is very small).
Then I can be motivated by my self and the comments from my network.
Automatically, I will learn new things even it is small to get encouraged by others.

### Question 3__Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

For example, as I get attracted to celebrate my success in learning a new thing and share my celebration through LinkedIn I definitely want that celebration again and again. So this will become a habit, and it brings a huge change in my life.

We can change our Identity by changing our behaviour, We can change our behaviour by adopting tiny habits every day, which don't need a lot of motivation.

### Question 6__Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

we can make a habit easier to do by modifying our surroundings.
Suppose if I kept the LinkedIn logo at my desktop after every skill I learned,  I will definitely post my success or the changes of posting my celebration will be increased, which would motivate me and I would become addicted to that celebration and learn a lot of things.

### Question 6__Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

We can make a habit easier to do by modifying our surroundings.
Suppose if I log out every time and enable two-step verification after I use Instagram, I will definitely decrease the usage of Instagram as I have to log in by typing my password and login ID, and I have to do two-step verification.

### Question 8:__Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

I will use LinkedIn to share my skillset and celebrate.
I will keep the LinkedIn logo on my desktop.
I will start chatting on LinkedIn with professionals whose messages will trigger me to use LinkedIn.

### Question 9:__Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

I want to decrease the usage of Instagram.
I will enable two-step verification, and I will log out every time I use Instagram.
